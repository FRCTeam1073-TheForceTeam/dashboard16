A COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE WONDROUS WORLD OF SMARTDASHBOARD

TO START
1.  download dashboard16 off the git
2.  make a folder in your C:\users\yourname called "SmartDashboard." then make a folder in that folder called "extensions." make a copy of the smartdashboard.jar file and put it in 
	"SmartDashboard"
3.  make a .batch file and save it out of the dashboard16 so it doesn't get destroyed with future dashboard updates
    in this .batch file, type two lines:
        copy /Y C:\Users\owner\team1073\dashboard16\Dashboard16Widgets\dist\Dashboard16Widgets.jar C:\Users\owner\team1073\dashboard16\Dashboard16Widgets\SmartDashboard\extensions
	    copy /Y C:\Users\owner\team1073\dashboard16\Dashboard16Widgets\dist\Dashboard16Widgets.jar C:\Users\owner\SmartDashboard\extensions
	but change them to your users\yourname\SmartDashboard\extensions folder and the extensions folder in the SmartDashboard folder in the Dashboard16Widgets folder
4.  to test with the robot, change widget code according to instructions in the DefaultWidget
5.  build the code. click the .batch file and open the dashboard
6.  if no widgets appear on the dashboard, look at the current layout .jpeg. click "View" then select "Editable." then add the widgets with "View/add/pickwidget"
7.  change back to non-editable
8.  if you run the non-static widgets without a robot, the dashboard will crash
9.  do not commit the code with the changes to static/@override
